# This Month in PLCT: Issue 37 (September 1, 2022)

## Preface

At the PLCT lab and the TAISIER team, we had a busy August preparing and hosting the second RISC-V Summit in China. Due to the ongoing pandemic, we have decided to hold the summit remotely, with over 12 sessions held concurrently in different cities in China. We would like to thank everyone for making this year's summit our largest one yet and a successful example for concurrent sessions in different local venues.

Last month also saw significant growth in our TAISIER. We grew our roster to 20 full-time staff members, began work on a RISC-V port for a distro named OpenAnolis, awarded title to our first LV4 intern, and commenced work with our BJ67 operating system observation project with over 8 interns.

In September, the PLCT lab will experiment with building an > 1,024-node RISC-V cluster. We look forward to working with you in this new project.

## Featured Topics

- Successful conclusion to the second RISC-V Summit in China.
- SpiderMonkey JIT support projected to see end-of-year completion with help from the V8 porting work group. Some baseline code already upstreamed.
- Graphical interface, Firefox, LibreOffice, etc. now available for OpenAnolis' RISC-V port.
- Zhang Xiang (章翔) to work on backporting RISC-V support to OpenJDK8 with a 16-week projected timeframe.

## DynamoRIO RV64GC Enablement

Preliminary support for RV64GC implemented in DynamoRIO, which will now build on RV64GC (no additional feature supported).

Current five-stage road map for DyanmoRIO's RV64GC support:

1. Introduce RISC-V platform-specific functions, frameworks, definitions, etc., allowing DynamoRIO to build on RISC-V. **(Done)**
2. Setup RISC-V CI for automated compilation and testing. _**(In Progress)**_
3. Refine RISC-V platform-specific functions and definitions, make DynamoRIO's built-in example tools functional.
4. Refine RISC-V unit- and feature-tests, setup CI for automated testing and instruments for long-term maintenance.
5. Continue RISC-V feature enablement for more complex programs, prepare for long-term maintenance.

See https://gist.github.com/bekcpear/7c9e710ee5b674888fcf5e5d8445dc16 for a more detailed to-do list.

## OpenCV for RV64GCV

As part of our GSoC 2022 project, we are currently implementing a new Universal Intrinsic backend for RVV (RISC-V Vector), making the existing Universal Intrinsic framework compatible with scalable (variable-length) backends.

Previously, we have already finished implementing the aforementioned changes to the Universal Intrinsic framework. In August, we have implemented all platform-specific Universal Intrinsic functions and introduced respective unit tests and submitted relevant patches to upstream:

 - [PR #22353](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22353): Add more universal intrinsic implementations for RVV
 - [PR #22429](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22429): Add remaining universal intrinsic implementations for RVV

As a result, the new Universal Intrinsic backend for RVV not only supports variable register lengths, it also improves performance significantly over the original backend design, which had an issue where it generated redundant Load/Store instructions. As a next step, we plan to optimize hot-spot functions OpenCV's image processing module and acquire RVV-enabled devices for performance testing.

## Cicada Langugage

We have been reimplementing Cicada since last month, aiming to add subtype system and recursion support to the original, and to enable interns to understand and learn the Cicada implementation better and experience a full dt-language development process.

Currently we have completed the following:

+ Five basic types: Pi, Sigma, Class, Quote, Trivial.
+ Some basic statements: Check, Compute, Let. We currently intend to implement an interactive editing environment based on statements.

In general, we have completed most of Cicada's original features and have discussed and tried to implement the subtyping system. The next generation of Cicada (which we are tentatively calling Cicada-Next) is currently under active development, so feel free to check it out at the [project repository](https://github.com/cicada-lang/cicada-next).

## RISC-V Platform Evaluation

## RVLab

1. Created a frontend for RVLab's hardware management platform using Vue.js.
  - Learning to make of Vue.js' parent and child component functionalities - using value passing and function calls in various dialog interfaces.
  - Completed device distribution, device editing, relay listing, new/delete relays, and delete device pages in the hardware management interface.
  - Completed user management, user roles, role listing, new/delete roles, delete user pages.
  - Completed the User Profile interface, as well as a functional Change Password page.
  - Successfully deployed the RVLab hardware management platform locally on a Ubuntu 22.04 system using Dockerfile and `docker compose`. This platform will be deployed for production in a virtual machine. Due to the fact that the MQTT server was deployed in the RVLab's internal network, the virtual machine will require both Internet and intranet access.
  - Revised Flask backend code to adapt to the Vue frontend.
2. RVLab infrastructure provisioning.
  - Installed the latest Debian image on one Unmatched board.
