# This Month in PLCT: Issue 38 (October 1, 2022)

## Preface

The PLCT Lab and the TARSIER team achieved much in the past month, notably:

- The PLCT Lab's founder, Wu Wei, has been elected for a two-year term on the LLVM Foundation's Board of Directors.
- Google's Android team started accepting code from the AOSP RISC-V project, which we started back in 2020.
- We began planning for a new series of courses on compiler and the PLCT Lab will start rolling them out in October.
- SpiderMonkey's RISC-V JIT port is well under way.
- LuaJIT's RISC-V port is also under way, we are projecting its completion in the next eight weeks.

In the coming month, we also have much to do. To start, we will continue planning for our RISC-V cluster. We will also start planning for our 2023 road map. The TARSIER team's end will start deliberating on starting a Linux distribution for the RV32GC architecture.

## Featured Topics

### Wu Wei, PLCT Lab Founder, Elected to the LLVM Board of Directors

In the August LLVM Board of Directors elections, Wu Wei from the PLCT Lab has been elected as a member. This is likely the first Chinese or East Asian board member to be elected since the BoD's founding in 2014.

Since its founding in 2014, the LLVM BoD holds 9 seats, with 6 permanent members (including LLVM's co-founder Chris Lattner) and 3 non-permanent members. Since non-permanent members are elected every two years, Wu Wei's term will start this October and end in October of 2024. Please note that the LLVM Foundation holds no authority over the LLVM community's technical decisions. Rather, it is a decision-making body that presides over issues of community operations, infrastructures, and legal.

### AOSP's RISC-V Support Upstreaming Under Way

In September, the AOSP upstream community accepted the first RISC-V support patchset. This marks the beginning of upstream AOSP support for RISC-V. It was two years in the making, involving both the RISC-V community and multiple other organization, who maintained an out-of-tree port between Android versions 10 through 12 since 2020.

The PLCT Lab was the first to maintain a public port, commencing work in August 2020, and completing a preliminary port in November that year. Ali's T-Head project is the first to finish a comprehensive port, open sourcing it on January 21, 2021. Following this achievement, the international RISC-V Foundation took over management and coordination of the porting effort. The RISC-V Foundation is also responsible for establishing an active and long-term line of contact with Google's Android team, communicating and negotiating the road map for official RISC-V support.

Since then, Institute of Software at the Chinese Academy of Science (the PLCT Lab's parent institution) gradually worked towards merging their porting effort under that of RISC-V Foundation's.

At present, there are still much to do and we need your help. If you are interested in the AOSP for RISC-V, please consider getting in touch with Wang Chen (汪辰). Wang Chen is one of the first developers to call for an AOSP for RISC-V project. You may email Wang Chen via his email at [wangchen20@iscas.ac.cn](mailto:wangchen20@iscas.ac.cn).

We would like to take this moment to express our gratitude for all developers and teams that make AOSP for RISC-V a reality.

### \[October Course Preview\] Attack on Debugger! Debugger and RISC-V Architecture Internals

Software development relies heavily on a good debugger (such as GDB and LLDB), but debugger specialists are few are far between. The PLCT Lab has invested much into porting and optimizing the debugger stack for RISC-V. However, as we developed extensions and compiled knowledge bases for the GNU and Clang/LLVM toolchains, we found that courses and training materials on debugger theories are desperately lacking. We have therefore decided to make this upcoming courses and seminar available for all, we look forward to meeting and working with everyone.

The PLCT strives to train future Chinese specialists on basic software infrastructures, such as compilers and virtual machines. In the past three years, we have designed and delivered courses on compilers, emulators, virtual machines, and RISC-V operating systems. The upcoming course will be the lastest building block to complete our series of open courses.

## Enable DynamoRIO running on RV64GC

Preliminary support for RV64GC implemented in DynamoRIO, which will now build on RV64GC (no additional feature supported).

Current five-stage road map for DyanmoRIO's RV64GC support:

1. Introduce RISC-V platform-specific functions, frameworks, definitions, etc., allowing DynamoRIO to build on RISC-V. **(Done)**
2. Setup RISC-V CI for automated compilation and testing. _**(In Progress)**_
3. Refine RISC-V platform-specific functions and definitions, make DynamoRIO's built-in example tools functional. _**(In Progress)**_
4. Refine RISC-V unit- and feature-tests, setup CI for automated testing and instruments for long-term maintenance.
5. Continue RISC-V feature enablement for more complex programs, prepare for long-term maintenance.

See https://gist.github.com/bekcpear/7c9e710ee5b674888fcf5e5d8445dc16 for a more detailed to-do list.

## OpenCV for RV64GCV

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2022 has come to a close. In this year's GSoC, we have achieved the following with OpenCV for RV64GCV:

1. Expanded the current Universal Intrinsic design, introducing variable-length register support for the vectorization architecture.
2. Implemented a new RISC-V Vector (RVV) backend with the Universal Intrinsic framework. This new backend includes support for the aforementioned variable-length registers and resolved an issue where the old backend generated redundant Load/Store instructions.
3. Rewrote some SIMD loops, improving performance on RVV-enabled platforms. See below for performance figures.

Take for example the frequently used median filter in image processing below - using the PLCT Lab's gem5 emulator, we observe an over 60% performance uplift as demonstrated in the reduction in numbers of instructions and ticks committed.

|                                   | scalar   | vector   | Reduction |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| Number of instructions committed  | 2.82E+08 | 9.81E+07 | 65.23%    |
| Number of ticks simulated         | 1.70E+11 | 6.20E+10 | 63.56%    |

## RISC-V Platform Evaluation

## RVLab

1. Created a frontend for RVLab's hardware management platform using Vue.js.
  - Learning to make of Vue.js' parent and child component functionalities - using value passing and function calls in various dialog interfaces.
  - Completed device distribution, device editing, relay listing, new/delete relays, and delete device pages in the hardware management interface.
  - Completed user management, user roles, role listing, new/delete roles, delete user pages.
  - Completed the User Profile interface, as well as a functional Change Password page.
  - Successfully deployed the RVLab hardware management platform locally on a Ubuntu 22.04 system using Dockerfile and `docker compose`. This platform will be deployed for production in a virtual machine. Due to the fact that the MQTT server was deployed in the RVLab's internal network, the virtual machine will require both Internet and intranet access.
  - Revised Flask backend code to adapt to the Vue frontend.
2. RVLab infrastructure provisioning.
  - Installed the latest Debian image on one Unmatched board.
