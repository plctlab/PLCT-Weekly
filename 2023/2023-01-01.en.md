# This Month in PLCT: Issue 41 (January 1, 2023)

## Preface

The PLCT Lab had harrowing January. Within weeks since the easing of lock-down, PLCT members from all around China contacted COVID-19. Topics of daily conversations were occupied by reports of positive tests and fevers. Luckily, all PLCT and TARSIER members prevailed through this challenging time, as we entered the new normal.

But let's not forget what a fruitful December we've had last year. On December 9th, we held PLCT OpenDay 2022, our 4th open-day event. All recordings of events and presentations has been uploaded to Bilibili for your viewing pleasure. On December 28th and 29th, at the annual openEuler Summit, members of PLCT and TARSIER, who took active roles in building the commercial-targeted EulixOS 2.0-RV, also helped organizing the RISC-V sub-forum.

In related news, Liu Xin (刘鑫) from the TARSIER team also received the 2022 openEuler developer of the year (openEuler 年度之星) award for his long-term contributions. Congratulations to Liu Xin!

Finally, in consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on our team members, this monthly report was delayed to January 22th. In lieu of a New Year's greeting, let's take this moment to celebrate the Lunar New Year. We wish you happiness in the new year!

## Featured Items

## Firefox (SpiderMonkey) on RV64GCV

Submitted a patch to the upstream to add riscv64 backend.r=jandem https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D161986.

Upstream did not review this change due to the holidays.

## Enable DynamoRIO running on RV64GC

Preliminary support for RV64GC is now implemented in DynamoRIO, which will now build on RV64GC (basic decoding is now supported).

Current five-stage road map for DyanmoRIO's RV64GC support:

1. Introduce RISC-V platform-specific functions, frameworks, definitions, etc., allowing DynamoRIO to build on RISC-V. **(Done)**
2. Setup RISC-V CI for automated compilation and testing. _**(In Progress)**_
3. Refine RISC-V platform-specific functions and definitions, make DynamoRIO's built-in example tools functional. _**(In Progress)**_
4. Refine RISC-V unit- and feature-tests, setup CI for automated testing and instruments for long-term maintenance.
5. Continue RISC-V feature enablement for more complex programs, prepare for long-term maintenance.

See https://gist.github.com/bekcpear/7c9e710ee5b674888fcf5e5d8445dc16 for a more detailed to-do list.

## OpenCV for RV64GCV

OpenCV 4.7.0 [was released](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.7.0) with a...

> New universal intrinsics backend for scalable vector instructions. The first scalable implementation for RISC-V RVV 1.0.

In 2023, we will focus on refactoring and migrating existing unified vector instruction codes. This will materialise in performance improvements for compute-intensive algorithms on RVV-enabled devices. Meanwhile, we will collaborate with the XiangShan processor team to better test and optimise the OpenCV RVV backend.

Other RISC-V related patches:

- [cmake: fix RISC-V toolchains](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22928)

## Experimental/simd in LIBCXX

- Compiled documentation for current simd library implementation, published as the repository's README file.
	- [https://github.com/plctlab/llvm-project/blob/simd_for_upstream/README.md](https://github.com/plctlab/llvm-project/blob/simd_for_upstream/README.md)
- Packaged current implementation and submitted a preliminary version to the upstream.
	- [https://reviews.llvm.org/D139421](https://reviews.llvm.org/D139421)
- Refactored and revised code in accordance with suggestions from the LLVM upstream reviewers.
- Added tests for the default constructors.

## opensbi

- Added Vim swap files to .gitignore, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003765.html)
- Updated debug trigger, added type2 support, endianness support (csr definitions implemented with struct bit-fields caused endianness issues, bit operations were used to workaround this issue), [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003767.html)
- Synchronize PMP settings with virtual memory system, adding synchronization instructions to `sbi_hart_pmp_configure`, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003814.html)
- Rewrite `fdt_find_match` with `fdt_find_node` in `fw_platform_lookup_special` to improve code readability, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003809.html)
- Fixed `fdt_parse_region` to avoid bit shift overflow, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003837.html)
- Fixed logical errors in error handling in `__fdt_parse_region`, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003838.html)
- Detects whether the region in fdt is valid through `sbi_is_region_valid`, the original code only detects region->order, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003834.html)
- Use `env` to invoke Bash in shebang, as Bash in FreeBSD is installed at `/usr/local/bin/bash`, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003851.html)
- Added clint support for T-Head c9xx, also specified c9xx mtime features using a quirk, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003911.html)
- Added Zisslpcfi support to opensbi, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003984.html)
- Updated core selection method during cold boot, replacing pre-processed behaviours to specifying using fdt, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003898.html)
- Split PMP permissions into M and SU modes (PMP lock is effective for M mode, but it also allows for access by lower privilege modes), [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/003946.html)
- Updated PMU property names in documentation, renamed `event-to-mhpmevent` as `riscv,event-to-mhpmevent`,[reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/004002.html)
- Updated documentation to remove the MCOUNTINHIBIT requirement for PMU extension implementations, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/004005.html)
- Dropped `-N` switch from linker flags. This flag creates singular load segments, resulting in segments with RWX permissions and an error in `ld` 2.39, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/004019.html)
- Allow custom HTIF base address for RV32, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/004020.html)
- sbi_hsm: Rename `priv` argument to `arg1`, [reference](https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/opensbi/2022-December/004067.html)

## RVLab

- Reported an issue where LAVA jobs could not complete execution using the `hifive-unleashed-a00.jinja2` device type template: https://github.com/kernelci/lava-docker/issues/162
  - Upstream identified a bug in the `hifive-unleashed-a00.jinja2` device type template, where upon device reboot, the serial port disappears.
- Learned to use Python module `labgrid` and attempted (unsuccessfully) to control serial communication using this module.
- Tested the Cloud-V CI interface and reported an issue to apply for an account: https://github.com/10x-Engineers/riscv-ci-partners/issues/27
- Learned to use KUnit and compiled notes on the process(Chinese), https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/594717218
- Wrote an Ubuntu 22.10 image for a LicheeRV board, built and ran Unixbench, and compiled notes on the process (Chinese), https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/595281400

## eBPF

New members joined the eBPF team, but most caught COVID.

### BCC upstream

- (Merged )libbpf-tools: fix uprobe helper possible overflow, [reference](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/4397)
- [Draft] Add bcc frontend action to convert BCC style source to libbpf style source, [reference](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/4405)

### eunomia-bpf

- Discussed project roadmap at OpenEuler, OpenAnolis, and various other places, [0.4.0-draft-roadmap](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/wiki/0.4.0-draft-roadmap)
- Imported `eunomia-bpf` as a user mode development library for Coolbpf (Aliyun's eBPF development framework), [reference](https://gitee.com/anolis/coolbpf/pulls/17)
- Attempted to reimplement a PoC tool for converting `bcc`-type kernel mode code to `libbpf` kernel mode code. This will allow "write once, run everywhere" and AOT features when using `bcc`-type kernel mode code in eunomia-bpf, [eunomia-bpf/bcc](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bcc/tree/master/src/cc/converter)
- Rewrote some `ecli` command line tools in Rust, [Add ecli-rs](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/pull/89)
- Wrote the first development tutorial for libbpf-based eBPF tools and attempted to generate an eBPF program using ChatGPT, [reference](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpf-developer-tutorial)
- Added a few code analysing tools in CI ([deepsource](https://deepsource.io/gh/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/?ref=repository-badge) and [codefactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf)) to help improve code quality and iron out minor issues discovered in the process.
- Added `codecov` to CI, improving unit test coverage from \~20% to 77%, [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf)
