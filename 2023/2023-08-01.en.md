# This Month in PLCT: Issue 48 (August 1, 2023)

## Preface

July ended in storms and rains and August marks the height of summer. The PLCT Lab took a week off due to intense heat, we hope that our colleagues have had a restful break!

## Featured Items

- DynamoRIO has successfully run a HelloWorld demo, thanks to the hard work from PLCT Lab engineer Liu Yang \[刘阳\]. This is the first time DynamoRIO has been put up for demo. The Institute of Software plans to finish porting DynamoRIO and integrate this piece of software in RuyiSDK's second free release to the RISC-V community. DynamoRIO is a performance analysis and code manipulation tool frequently used by developers, a RISC-V port is sure to benefit platform developers around the world.
- This year's RISC-V China Summit will be held in Beijing between August 23rd and 25th, see you there!

    - Alibaba will submit their `jdk11u` backporting work in the `riscv-port-jdk11u` staging repo.
    - Whether it will ever be upstreamed into the long-term-support `jdk11u` is another matter.

## Aya Theorem Prover

## eBPF

- eunomia-bpf 1.0 will soon be released with basic support for most use cases.
  - [Use cross-build to build aarch64 docker image](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/pull/277)
  - [Add profile support](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/pull/286)
  - [Add workflow to release aarch64 standalone ecc binary](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/pull/279 https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/pull/281)
- [Add release workflows for wasm_bpf plugin, and the reletad installing script](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/pull/2610)
- We are currently developing an experimental project to implement a high-performance, user-mode eBPF runtime and tracing framework (to be open source'd soon).
  - Implemented an LLVM-based eBPF JIT, which now successfully runs test suites such as bpf-conformance and ubpf on x86.
  - Implemented basic use cases like hotpatch and uprobe, as well as several simple PoCs.
  - Supports x86/arm64/arm32 platforms.
- Improved the [develpoper tutorial](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpf-developer-tutorial) and fixed several typesetting issues.
- Refactored [GPTtrace](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/GPTtrace) to make it more useful.
  - Makes use of OpenAI function calls,
  - Refactored vector database components.
  - Acquires hook points using bpftrace.
- An experiment AI agent for automatic monitoring of system performance, [trace-agent](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/trace-agent).

## RISC-V Platform Evaluation

We benchmarked jemalloc's performance impact for CPU2017 on an Unmatched development board, the results are as follows. Jemalloc improves benchmark results for the INT test suite, especially for INTRATE.

We also discovered that GCC 13 causes performance regression for 620.omnetpp_s, a 40% degradation from GCC 11 and 12.

## Testing and Development

- Compiled a technical presentation on deploying and using Kernel CI environments.
- Surveyed openEuler RISC-V's security testing methodologies.
  - Compiled and ran nmap, a network security testing utility, on openEuler RISC-V, [documenting the process](https://gitee.com/jean9823/open-euler_riscv_security_test/blob/master/%E5%9C%A8openEuler%20riscv64%E4%B8%AD%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8nmap%E6%89%A7%E8%A1%8C%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.md).
  - Compiled and ran Trinity, a Kernel fuzzing utility, on openEuler RISC-V, [documenting the process](https://gitee.com/jean9823/open-euler_riscv_security_test/blob/master/%E5%9C%A8openEuler%20riscv64%E4%B8%AD%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8Trinity%E6%89%A7%E8%A1%8Ckernel%E6%A8%A1%E7%B3%8A%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.md).
